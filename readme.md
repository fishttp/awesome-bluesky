# Awesome Bluesky

[Bluesky](https://github.com/bluesky-social/) is an open-source microblogging platform powered by the [AT Protocol](https://atproto.com/). This protocol enables the creation of powerful third party tools, enlisted here for easy reference.

Are you a programmer? Check out [Awesome ATProto](https://github.com/beeman/awesome-atproto) which has some overlap with this list but many more resources for libraries, bots, and the like. This list is intended for end user facing software and tools. [The Bluesky Index](https://github.com/scrub-dev/bsky-index/) is another great list to check out as well.

Know of another tool? Either submit it here as a pull request or simply tell me ([@fish.posting.lol](https://bsky.app/profile/fish.posting.lol)) about it on Bluesky.

Always use an app password, never your main password!
